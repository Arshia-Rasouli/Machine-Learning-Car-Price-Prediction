# Machine-Learning-Car-Price-Prediction
 Machine Learning project for predicting car prices using Python and Sklearn
 
# Car Price Prediction
In this project, I’ve built a **Machine Learning model** to predict car prices based on various features such as mileage, year, and brand. The project includes **data cleaning, preprocessing, model training**, and **evaluation**.

## Project Goal
The goal of this project is to predict the price of cars using **Linear Regression**. I worked on cleaning the data, transforming it, and building a model to predict prices.

## Steps Involved:
- **Data Cleaning**: Removing missing values and outliers.
- **Feature selection**: selectig the useful features.
- **Data Preprocessing**: log transform and no multicollinearity and creat dummy varaibles .
- **Model Training**: Using Linear Regression to train the model.
- **Evaluation**: Checking the model’s performance and testing.

## Model & Evaluation

The model used here is **Linear Regression** from the `sklearn` library.
The **R² score of 0.74** means the model explains **74% of the variance** in car prices, showing it works good for the given dataset.

## About project
This is my first project in my learning journey of Machine Learning, where I focus on analyzing real data and building regression model.
